{
  "your_prompt_type": {
    "template": "Your template with {USER_INPUT} placeholder",
    "description": "Description of your prompt type",
    "input_placeholder": "Guidance for users"
  }
}
```

### Adding New Models

Modify `models/load_model.py` to include additional lightweight models:

```python
def load_models() -> List[str]:
    return [
        "your/custom-model",
        # ... existing models
    ]
```

### Theme Customization

Edit `.streamlit/config.toml` to customize colors and appearance:

```toml
[theme]
primaryColor = "#FF6B6B"
backgroundColor = "#FFFFFF"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#F0F2F6"
textColor = "#262730"
```
