# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fix

## ❌ **Problem Identified**
The deployment was failing because:
- `sentencepiece>=0.1.99` requires `cmake` and `pkg-config` system dependencies
- These build tools are not available in Streamlit Cloud's Python 3.13 environment
- T5-based models (`google/flan-t5-small`) require sentencepiece for tokenization

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Removed Problematic Dependencies**
```diff
- sentencepiece>=0.1.99
```

### 2. **Updated Model List**
```diff
- "google/flan-t5-small"  # Requires sentencepiece
+ "microsoft/DialoGPT-small"  # Pure PyTorch, no extra deps
```

### 3. **Simplified Model Loading**
- Removed T5-specific logic (`text2text-generation` task)
- All models now use standard `text-generation` task
- No special tokenizer requirements

## 🧪 **Verification Completed**
- ✅ App imports successfully
- ✅ All models work with standard transformers
- ✅ Streamlit starts without errors
- ✅ No system dependencies required

## 📦 **Final Requirements**
```txt
streamlit>=1.28.0
transformers>=4.30.0
torch>=2.0.0
accelerate>=0.20.0
```

## 🤖 **Updated Model List**
1. **sshleifer/tiny-gpt2** - Ultra-lightweight (~40MB)
2. **distilgpt2** - Efficient GPT-2 variant (~353MB)  
3. **microsoft/DialoGPT-small** - Conversational AI (~353MB)

## 🎯 **Deployment Ready**
The app should now deploy successfully on Streamlit Cloud without any build errors!
